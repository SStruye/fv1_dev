# FV1 dev board
- the FV1 is a widely used reverb I2C that is programmable.
- I build a dev board around it for use as a guitar pedal design platform.
- the devboard has a onboard usb programmer, buffered in and output, 3 positional dip switch for the FV1, 3 variable resistor for the FV1, 1 variable resistor for volume and one for mixing the clean and effects signal.
- a 4 layer pcb design was made for better signal integrity.
- Some small mistakes are still in the design but it works.
- Further improvements won't be added for the foreseeable future as intrests shifted.
