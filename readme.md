# FV1 dev board
- the FV1 is a widely used reverb I2C that is programmable.
- I build a dev board around it for use as a guitar pedal design platform.
- a 4 layer pcb design was made for better signal integrity.
- Some small mistakes are still in the design but it works.
- Further improvements won't be added for the foreseable future as intrests lie elsewhre atm.
